# Requirements

## Introduction
	A scientific calculator is a type of electronic calculator, usually but not always handheld, designed to calculate problems in science, engineering, and mathematics. They have almost completely replaced slide rules in traditional applications, and are widely used in both education and professional settings.
## Research
	Scientific calculators are used widely in situations that require quick access to certain mathematical functions, especially those that were once looked up in mathematical tables, such as trigonometric functions or logarithms. They are also used for calculations of very large or very small numbers, as in some aspects of astronomy, physics, and chemistry.

	The main goal of our project is to provide aids in advancing student understanding without replacing the need for other calculation methods. 
## Features
	Scientific calculators include exponents, log, natural log (ln), trig functions, and memory.   These functions are vital when you're working with scientific notation or any formula with a geometry component. Basic calculators can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
## Benefits
	This technology allows students solve complicated problems quickly and in an efficient manner. Additionally, it can reduce the problem to simpler tasks and allows the student to devote more time in understanding the problem. Secondly, they are saved from monotonous calculations and the same boring mundane procedure.
# Defining Our System
## Explanation
	It has a various types of operation so, That the user can solve the problem in quick manner and it has an few inbulit features like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power,  square, cube, root, squareroot, factorial, modulus, sinc, cosc, tanc, logc.
